# bitburner local dev server

## Usage

### Install dependencies:

`pnpm install`

`npm install` or `yarn` should work, too.

### Run server and TypeScript watch task

`npm start`

### In-game

First, create `sync.js` in the game. This is only needed once.

After changing a source file, run `run sync.js`. This will copy over the compiled scripts to your current machine and all purchased servers.
